Realtime-safe disk streaming to/from audio files using [Symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia) to support a variety of codecs. Refer to [Symphonia's documentation](https://docs.rs/symphonia/latest/symphonia/#support) for supported codecs. Symphonia's Cargo features are exposed with the prefix `decode-`, except `aac` and `isomp4` which creek does not work with yet. For example, to enable MP3 decoding in creek, enable the `decode-mp3` feature.

## How the Read Stream Works

![how it works](how_it_works.svg)

The stream has two types of buffers: a `cache` buffer and `look-ahead` buffer.

A `cache` buffer is a user-defined range (of a fixed user-defined number of blocks) starting from any frame in the file. Caches must be loaded before they can be used. The default size for a block is 16384 frames in length.

There are a number of `look-ahead` blocks ahead of the currently used cache block/playhead. These automatically load-in to ensure that data will always be ready even in the worse-case IO latency scenerio. A number of `look-ahead` blocks are added to the end of every `cache` buffer to ensure enough data is always available.

The stream can have as many `cache` buffers as desired. When seeking to a frame in the file, the stream searches for a cache that contains that frame. If one does, then it uses it and playback can resume immediately. A common use case is to cache the start of a file or loop region for seamless looping.

If a suitable cache is not found (or the cache is not loaded yet), then the `look-ahead` buffer will need to fill-up before any more data can be read. In this case, you may choose to either continue playback (which will output silence) or to temporarily pause playback.

This stream automatically spawns an "IO server" that handles the non-realtime safe operations. This server is automatically closed when the stream is dropped.

## How the Write Stream Works

The write stream works how you would expect. Once a block is filled with data, it is sent to the IO server to be written. This block is also recycled back to the stream after writing is done.

### Codecs (Encode)

| Codec  | Status                                          | Default |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Wav    | :heavy_check_mark: Uncompressed, no channel map | Yes     |
| FLAC   | ? Not currently on roadmap                      | No      |
| MP3    | ? Not currently on roadmap                      | No      |
| Opus   | ? Not currently on roadmap                      | No      |
| PCM    | ? Not currently on roadmap                      | No      |
| Vorbis | ? Not currently on roadmap                      | No      |

## Examples

### Simple Usage Example

```rust
use creek::{
    SymphoniaDecoder, SeekMode, ReadDiskStream,
    WriteDiskStream, WavEncoder, wav_bit_depth
};

// Open a read stream.


let mut read_disk_stream = ReadDiskStream::<SymphoniaDecoder>::new(
    "./test_files/wav_f32_stereo.wav",  // Path to file.
    0,  // The frame in the file to start reading from.
    Default::default(),  // Use default read stream options.
).unwrap();

// Cache the start of the file into cache with index `0`.
let _ = read_disk_stream.cache(0, 0);

// Tell the stream to seek to the beginning of file. This will also alert the stream to the existence
// of the cache with index `0`.
read_disk_stream.seek(0, Default::default()).unwrap();

// Wait until the buffer is filled before sending it to the process thread.
//
// NOTE: Do ***not*** use this method in a real-time thread.
read_disk_stream.block_until_ready().unwrap();

// (Send `read_stream` to the audio processing thread)


// Open a write stream.


WriteDiskStream::<WavEncoder<wav_bit_depth::Float32>>::new(
    "./test_files/wav_f32_stereo_out.wav",  // Path to file.
    2,  // The number of channels in the file
    44100,  // The sample rate of the file
    Default::default(),  // Use default write stream options.
).unwrap();

// (Send `write_stream` to the audio processing thread)


// -------------------------------------------------------------


// In the realtime audio processing thread:


// Update read client and check if it is ready.
//
// NOTE: You should avoid using `unwrap()` in realtime code.
if !read_disk_stream.is_ready().unwrap() {
    // If the look-ahead buffer is still buffering, We can choose to either continue
    // reading (which will return silence), or pause playback until the buffer is filled.
}

let read_data = read_disk_stream.read(num_frames_in_output_buffer).unwrap();

println!("{}", read_data.num_frames());
println!("{}", read_data.num_channels());

// Seek to a new position in the file.
read_disk_stream.seek(50000, SeekMode::Auto};

assert_eq!(read_dist_stream.playhead(), 50000);


// Send stereo data to be written to disk.

write_disk_stream.write(
    &[read_data.read_channel(0), read_data.read_channel(1)]
).unwrap();
```

### Demos

- A basic [`looping demo player`] that plays a single wav file with adjustable loop regions.
- A basic [`writer app`] that records a tone to a wav file.

## Contributing

We use various [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to ensure that the code style and formatting
is consistent.

Follow the [installation instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#install) on how to set up _pre-commit_ for your development system. This allows you to run the checks locally before committing code
and waiting for the CI results:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Git

Conventions for working with Git:

- Commits should follow the [seven rules](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules).
- Versions are tagged with the prefix `v` followed by the crate's version number to match those displayed on the [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/creek) page.
